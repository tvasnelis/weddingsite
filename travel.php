	    	<h3>Airport Transportation</h3>
	    		<p>Public transporation is just about nonexisitent.  Your best bet is a taxi or Uber.  Both services offer a flat rate of $33 for up to 2 passengers.</p>
	    		<p>Due to airport restrictions Uber can only pick-up in the Ground Transportation center.  Taxi stands are located on the first level of the terminal outside Baggage Claim Belts 1 and 14.</p>

	    	<h3>Getting Around</h3>
	    		<p>Having a vehicle during your stay is not necessary but may be convenient if you plan to visit a lot of spots outside the French Quarter.  The venues and hotels are located within the French Quarter.  A large part of the city is walkable and it is a great way to get around.  If you want to visit somewhere farther out, Uber and taxis are again a great option.  Checkout the <a hfref="experience.php">Experience</a> page to see where you can find us in New Orleans!
